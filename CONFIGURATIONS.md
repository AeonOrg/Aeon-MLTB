  **Notes**:
  - Don't add ffmpeg at the beginning!
  - Add `-del` to the list which you want from the bot to delete the original files after command run complete!
  - To execute one of those lists in bot for example, you must use -ff subtitle (list key) or -ff convert (list key)
  **Example**:
  - Here I will explain how to use mltb.* which is reference to files you want to work on.
  1. First cmd: the input is mltb.mkv so this cmd will work only on mkv videos and the output is mltb.mkv also so all outputs is mkv. `-del` will delete the original media after complete run of the cmd.
  2. Second cmd: the input is mltb.video so this cmd will work on all videos and the output is only mltb so the extenstion is same as input files.
  3. Third cmd: the input in mltb.m4a so this cmd will work only on m4a audios and the output is mltb.mp3 so the output extension is mp3.
  4. Fourth cmd: the input is mltb.audio so this cmd will work on all audios and the output is mltb.mp3 so the output extension is mp3.
  5. FFmpeg Variables in last cmd which is metadata ({title}, {title2}, etc...), you can edit them in usetting
  6. Telegram link for small size inputs like photo to set watermark.

    - script will get replaced by code with sensitive case
    - mirror will get replaced by leech
